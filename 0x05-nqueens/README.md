The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

Concepts Needed:
Backtracking Algorithms:

Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
Backtracking Introduction
Recursion:

Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
Recursion in Python
List Manipulations in Python:

Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
Python Lists
Python Command Line Arguments:

Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
Command Line Arguments in Python
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
